# rustic_rogues

Rustic Rogues is a simple educational rust roguelike project utilizing the Bevy Engine. It'll have basic roguelike elements such as a tile-based map of enemies to fight and turn-based gameplay. My code is built upon the first few articles of Maciej Główka's "Bevy roguelike tutorial" (https://maciejglowka.com/blog/bevy-roguelike-tutorial-devlog-part-1/). This tutorial was an enlightening introduction to Bevy, and helped a lot with laying the foundation of the project, such as how to generate a tile-based map, and spawn entities.
