# rustic_rogues

Rustic Rogues is a simple educational rust roguelike project utilizing the Bevy Engine. It'll have basic roguelike elements such as a tile-based map of enemies to fight and turn-based gameplay. My code is built upon the first few articles of Maciej Główka's "Bevy roguelike tutorial" (https://maciejglowka.com/blog/bevy-roguelike-tutorial-devlog-part-1/). This tutorial was an enlightening introduction to Bevy, and helped with a few foundational elements, i.e, generating a tile-based map, spawning entities, and implementing a queue for turn-based mechanics.

Controls
WASD - Movement\
Q - Attack\

The enemies have 3 HP

Initially learning how to use the engine, like how to query entities and components, was the most difficult part. I wish I had gotten more important foundational features implemented.

Unit tests were used to test combat logic.
